## 1. Voltage Divider Design Calculations

### Required Attenuation Ratio:
```
Peak input voltage = 265V × √2 = 375V (worst case)
ADE7953 max input = 500mV differential
Safety margin = 80% (400mV usable)

Required ratio = 375V / 0.4V = 937.5:1
Design ratio = 940:1 (for margin)
```

### Resistor Value Selection:
```
Total resistance = R_high + R_low
R_high = 2.2MΩ (high voltage side)
R_low = 3.6kΩ (ADE7953 side)

Actual ratio = 2.2036MΩ / 3.6kΩ = 612:1

For 220V input:
V_out = 220V × (3.6kΩ / 2.2036MΩ) = 0.359V peak
✓ Within ADE7953 range (±0.5V)
```

### Precision Analysis:
```
R1 tolerance: ±1%
R3 tolerance: ±1%
Combined tolerance: √(1² + 1²) = ±1.41%

Temperature coefficient (metal film): 100ppm/°C
Over 50°C range: ±0.5%

Total ratio accuracy: ±√(1.41² + 0.5²) = ±1.49%
```

## 2. Power Dissipation Analysis

### High-Side Resistors (R1, R2):
```
Continuous power at 265V:
P_R1 = V² / R = (265V)² / 2.2MΩ = 31.9mW

Peak power during surge (2kV, 1ms):
P_peak = (2000V)² / 2.2MΩ = 1.82W (short duration)

Selected rating: 100mW continuous, 2W pulse
Material: Metal film for stability
```

### Low-Side Resistors (R3, R4):
```
Maximum voltage across R3:
V_R3 = 265V × (3.6kΩ / 2.2036MΩ) = 0.433V

Power dissipation:
P_R3 = (0.433V)² / 3.6kΩ = 52µW

Selected rating: 1/4W (massive overrating for reliability)
```

## 3. Protection Circuit Design

### TVS Diode Selection:
```
Standoff voltage: 275V (above peak AC)
Clamping voltage: 430V @ 1A (protects divider)
Peak current capability: 164A (for IEC surge test)

Selected: SMBJ275A or equivalent
```

### Series Protection Resistors:
```
Purpose: Current limiting during TVS clamping
Value: R5, R6 = 100Ω each

During TVS operation:
I_clamp = (430V - 400mV) / 100Ω = 4.3A
Power: P = I² × R = (4.3A)² × 100Ω = 1.85kW (pulse)

Selected: 1/2W pulse-rated resistors
```

## 4. Filter Network Design

### RC Low-Pass Filter:
```
R_series = 100Ω (R5, R6)
C_filter = 33nF (C1, C2)

Cutoff frequency:
f_c = 1 / (2π × RC) = 1 / (2π × 100Ω × 33nF) = 48.2kHz

Attenuation at power frequencies:
@ 50Hz: -0.001dB (no effect)
@ 3kHz: -0.04dB (60th harmonic preserved)
@ 50kHz: -3dB (noise suppressed)
```

### Capacitor Specifications:
```
Voltage rating: 630V AC (safety factor 2.4x)
Type: Ceramic X2 (designed for AC line filtering)
Temperature coefficient: X7R for stability

```

### Calibration Procedure:
```

## 6. Input Impedance Analysis

### Differential Mode Impedance:
```
Z_diff = R_total = 2.2MΩ + 3.6kΩ ≈ 2.2MΩ

Input current at 220V:
I_input = 220V / 2.2MΩ = 100µA

Power consumption from mains:
P_total = V² / R = (220V)² / 2.2MΩ = 22mW
```

## 7. Frequency Response Analysis

### Voltage Divider Response:
```

Parasitic capacitance effect:
C_parasitic ≈ 5pF (PCB + component)

High frequency rolloff:
f_3dB = 1 / (2π × 2.2MΩ × 5pF) = 14.5MHz
```

### Filter Network Response:
```
Low-pass filter: f_c = 48.2kHz

Phase response:
φ(f) = -arctan(f / f_c)

At 50Hz: φ = -0.06° (negligible)
At 1kHz: φ = -1.2° (acceptable for power measurement)

Protection verification:
V_surge = 2kV applied
V_divider_out = 2kV × (3.6kΩ / 2.2MΩ) = 3.27V
TVS clamps at 430V, limiting actual stress
